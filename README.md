# NBA-Scraper
A web application that visualizes stats for any NBA player in history using Python, Flask, and BeautifulSoup.

For the backend, I used Python, BeautifulSoup, and Plotly. The data is webscraped off of https://www.basketball-reference.com. The store the data based on the player searched in
multiple lists. The scraped data is visualized in both a line graph and radar chart. The line graph shows the season averages of points, assists, and rebounds throughout the
player's career. The radar chart depicts the player's stats compared to the average NBA player. It is an easy way to show how dominant a player was in certain statistics. 

For the frontend, I used Flask. I used a simple search bar to search for any player. There are two buttons to go to either chart: the line graph and radar chart.
